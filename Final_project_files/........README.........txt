Description of submitted work and how to access data.

#########################################################

The main folder contains an assortment of image files, .py files, a csv file, a folder called 'Simple' and a single .ipynb file: Depth_estimation_final_copy.ipynb

The notebook file is our final submission.

.py files are refactored python functions that are imported into the main notebook to save space.
The images are used as figures in the notebook file and the 'Simple' folder contains a few more images.

The csv file is a simple data description file and is imported into the notebook file also.

There is also a saved, trained CNN model called model_21052020 that can be used instead of training from scratch.

If you were to run the notebook start to finish (after changing the path directories of course) it would take around 14 hours.
Due to this, I have saved some of the data along the way as well as calculated statistics so you can load in those instead if you please.

I have zipped the Moderate Collection (Main used dataset) for convenience if you would to only like part to access the main training data.
This dataset is used throughout the project and you will need to change a few lines of code (some f-strings) so that the Moderate_Dataset (Dataset class) will work correctly.

This is all explained in the code.


Any issues with accessing data, not being able to download or if you cannot execute cells then please email me personally: Ben Snow, bsnow@bournemouth.ac.uk.


Best wishes and stay safe
